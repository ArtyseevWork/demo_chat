  <h2>Demo Project: Chat</h2>
  <p>This project uses the classic Clean Architecture pattern, Riverpod, WebSocket for chat functionality, and HTTP requests for user login and authentication.</p>
  <p>Additionally, an architecture diagram (ChatStructureDiagram.png) is attached to the project, which will help you understand the entire structure. I highly recommend checking it out. Have a great day!</p>
  <p>To simulate the backend part of the application, Mockoon software was used. The Mockoon settings file <strong>mockoonPandaChatSettings.json</strong> is attached to the project.</p>
  <p>Due to limitations in the backend, the project should be run from an emulator, as requests are made to the IP <code>http://10.0.2.2:3001</code>.</p>
